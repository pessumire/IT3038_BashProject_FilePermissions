# IT3038_BashProject_PermissionsManager

# This script is to help someone with viewing and editing permissions on specific files.

#For this scenario, the use case for the Permissions Manager would be an IT administrator who would be editing permissions based on two different directories.

#One directory is for IT users as these people will have elevated permissions in general. And the other directory will be for the regular employees of XYZ company.

#Each directory will contain 3 different files. General, Managers, and Admins.

# So it will look something like this: 
# Directory 1: IT > IT_General, IT_Managers, IT_Admins
# Directory 2: Employees > General, Managers, Admins
